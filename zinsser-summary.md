# Zinsser, _On Writing Well_, Chapters 2-3

Summary by Jerome Revilla

Chapters 2 and 3 , Zinsserâ€™s points is to keep it simple and 
take away the clutter in our writing. We can do this by taking 
away words that serve no function, turn long words into short 
word, take out adverbs that has the same meaning as the verb, 
and any passive construction that can make the reader unsure 
of who is doing what. He mentions that the reader has a very 
short attention span and it is hard to get it back once we 
(the writers) lose that attention. Rewriting work is key to 
make tighter and refined pieces.
